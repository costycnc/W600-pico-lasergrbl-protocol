? - Current status
The ? command immediately returns Grbl's active state and the real-time current position, both in machine coordinates and work coordinates. This may be sent at any time and works asynchronously with all other processes that Grbl is doing. The $13 Grbl setting determines whether it reports millimeters or inches. When ? is pressed, Grbl will immediately reply with something like the following:

<Idle,MPos:5.529,0.560,7.000,WPos:1.529,-5.440,-0.000>
The active states Grbl can be in are: Idle, Queue, Run, Hold, Home, Alarm, Check

Idle: All systems are go and it's ready for anything.
Queue: Motion(s) are queued in the planner buffer waiting for a cycle start command to be issued. Certain processes like check g-code mode can't run while something is queued. Reset to clear the queue.
Run: Indicates a cycle is running.
Hold: A feed hold is in process of executing, or slowing down to a stop. After the hold is complete, Grbl will enter a Queue state, waiting for a cycle start to resume the program.
Home: In the middle of a homing cycle. NOTE: Positions are not updated live during the homing cycle, but they'll be set to [0,0,0] once done.
Alarm: This indicates something has gone wrong or Grbl doesn't know its position. This state locks out all g-code commands, but allows you to interact with Grbl's settings if you need to. '$X' kill alarm lock releases this state and puts Grbl in the Idle state, which will let you move things again. As said before, be cautious of what you are doing after an alarm.
Check: Grbl is in check g-code mode. It will process and respond to all g-code commands, but not motion or turn on anything. Once toggled off with another '$C' command, Grbl will reset itself.
